Pretend that this string was loaded from a web page.  
We won't go to all that trouble here.  At least now we're load it from a file.
This string contains multiple words. 
And multiple copies of multiple words.  And multiple words with multiple copies.  
It is to be used as a test to demonstrate how sets work in removing redundancy by keeping only one copy of each thing. 
Is it very very redundant in having more than one copy of some words?
